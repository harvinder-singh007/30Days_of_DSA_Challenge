You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


class Solution:

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0

        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[i]
            profit = prices[i] - min_price
            
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
        
        return max_profit
